# Exploring-the-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-Market-DataCamp-project

To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies you will, in this project, explore the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies.

Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose.

This project uses the dataset downloaded on the 6th of December of 2017 using the coinmarketcap API (NOTE: The public API went private in 2020 and is no longer available)
